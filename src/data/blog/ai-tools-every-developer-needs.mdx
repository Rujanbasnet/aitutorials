## The AI-Powered Developer Toolkit

The development landscape has shifted dramatically. AI tools are no longer optional extras — they're essential parts of the modern developer workflow. Here are seven tools that are making the biggest impact.

## 1. Claude Code (CLI)

Anthropic's command-line AI assistant that lives in your terminal. It can read your codebase, make edits, run tests, and help you ship faster. Think of it as pair programming with an AI that never gets tired.

**Best for:** Complex refactoring, debugging, multi-file changes

## 2. Cursor

An AI-first code editor built on VS Code. Cursor understands your entire codebase and can make intelligent suggestions across files. The "Composer" feature lets you describe changes in natural language.

**Best for:** Day-to-day coding, rapid prototyping

## 3. GitHub Copilot

The original AI coding assistant, now deeply integrated into VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. Copilot excels at inline code completion and generating boilerplate.

**Best for:** Autocomplete, repetitive code patterns

## 4. v0 by Vercel

Describe a UI component in natural language and v0 generates production-ready React code with Tailwind CSS. It's incredibly fast for prototyping interfaces.

**Best for:** UI prototyping, component generation

## 5. Perplexity

An AI-powered search engine that actually understands developer queries. Instead of scrolling through Stack Overflow, get direct answers with source citations.

**Best for:** Technical research, API documentation lookup

## 6. Notion AI

If you use Notion for documentation (and you should), Notion AI helps you write, edit, and organize docs faster. Great for writing technical specs and meeting notes.

**Best for:** Documentation, project planning

## 7. Midjourney / DALL-E

Need placeholder images, icons, or design concepts? AI image generators can create custom visuals for your projects without hiring a designer.

**Best for:** Prototyping visuals, placeholder content

## The Key Principle

Don't try to use every tool at once. Pick one or two that address your biggest pain points, master them, then expand. The developers who thrive aren't the ones using the most AI tools — they're the ones using the right tools effectively.
