## Two Approaches to AI Coding

Cursor and Claude Code represent two fundamentally different philosophies for AI-assisted development.

**Cursor** is a VS Code fork with AI deeply integrated into the IDE. It intercepts your edits, understands your codebase, and offers inline completions and chat.

**Claude Code** is a terminal-based agent that operates alongside your existing editor. It reads, writes, and modifies files autonomously while you maintain your preferred development environment.

## The Case for Cursor

### Inline Experience
Cursor's tab completion is genuinely addictive. It predicts your next edit with uncanny accuracy, especially after it's indexed your codebase. The inline diff view for suggested changes is elegant.

### Familiar Environment
If you're a VS Code user, the transition is seamless. Your extensions, keybindings, and settings carry over. The AI is an enhancement, not a replacement.

### Multi-File Awareness
Cursor's Composer feature understands context across files. It can make coordinated changes to a component, its tests, and its types simultaneously.

### Where It Falls Short
- **Locked to one editor** — Vim, Neovim, and JetBrains users are out of luck
- **Suggestion fatigue** — Constant inline suggestions can be distracting
- **Limited autonomy** — It suggests, but you still have to approve every change

## The Case for Claude Code

### True Autonomy
Claude Code doesn't just suggest changes — it makes them. Tell it to refactor a module, add tests, fix a bug, and it does the work end-to-end. You review the result, not every intermediate step.

### Editor Agnostic
Use whatever editor you want. Claude Code runs in the terminal and modifies files directly. Vim, Emacs, Sublime, JetBrains — it doesn't care.

### Deep Reasoning
For complex tasks — architectural refactors, debugging tricky issues, implementing features that span many files — Claude Code's ability to think through the problem and execute a plan is remarkable.

### Where It Falls Short
- **Terminal-only interface** — Not everyone loves the command line
- **Requires trust** — You're giving an AI agent write access to your codebase
- **No inline completions** — It's not predicting your next keystroke
- **Can overcorrect** — Sometimes makes more changes than necessary

## Head-to-Head

| Feature | Cursor | Claude Code |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Inline completions | Excellent | None |
| Autonomous changes | Limited | Excellent |
| Editor freedom | VS Code only | Any editor |
| Complex refactors | Good | Excellent |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium |
| Cost | $20/month | Usage-based |

## My Recommendation

**Use Cursor if** you want AI assistance while maintaining full control of every edit. It's the best co-pilot experience available.

**Use Claude Code if** you want an AI teammate that can handle entire tasks autonomously. It's the best agent-based coding experience.

**Use both** if you want the ultimate setup: Cursor for daily coding with inline completions, Claude Code for big tasks that require autonomous execution.

## The Bottom Line

These tools aren't really competing — they're solving different problems. The real competition is with the old way of writing every line of code by hand. Both tools make that feel increasingly unnecessary.
