## The Challenge

Build a complete, production-quality content website from scratch. Not a template. Not a toy. A real site with multiple content types, a custom design system, responsive layouts, SEO, and deployment — all in one day.

## The Stack

- **Astro 5** — Static site generator with MDX support
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling
- **GitHub Pages** — Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Claude Code** — AI coding agent that did the heavy lifting

## The Process

### Hour 1: Planning

Started by describing the vision to Claude Code: an AI learning platform with tutorials, news, blog posts, and resources. The agent researched modern web stacks and proposed the architecture.

### Hours 2-4: Foundation

The agent scaffolded the entire project:
- Set up Astro with TypeScript, MDX, and Tailwind
- Created 5 content collections with Zod schemas
- Built the design system (color tokens, typography, card styles)
- Created all layout components (base, content, product)

### Hours 5-7: Components and Pages

Built all the UI components and pages:
- Header with responsive mobile menu
- Footer with newsletter CTA
- Post cards, badges, buttons, callouts
- Homepage, listing pages, about, newsletter, 404
- RSS feed, sitemap, SEO meta tags

### Hours 8-10: Content and Polish

Created seed content for all collections, refined the design based on preview feedback, and set up the GitHub Actions deployment pipeline.

## What Worked

**Clear communication** — The more specific my instructions, the better the output.

**Iterative refinement** — The first draft of the design wasn't great. Saying "this looks generic" and giving specific direction led to something much better.

**Letting the agent work** — Instead of micromanaging every file, I gave high-level instructions and reviewed the results. Much faster than dictating every line.

## What I'd Do Differently

**Start with design inspiration** — I should have shared reference sites upfront instead of trying to describe the aesthetic in words.

**Write more content first** — Having real content would have made design decisions easier. Designing around placeholder text always leads to rework.

**Test on mobile earlier** — I waited too long to check responsive layouts and had to fix several issues.

## The Result

A fully functional, beautifully designed website with:
- 27+ pages generated from content collections
- Custom editorial design with Instrument Serif typography
- Responsive layouts that work on all screen sizes
- SEO optimized with Open Graph and Twitter cards
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- RSS feed and sitemap

All from a single conversation with an AI coding agent.

## Takeaway

AI doesn't replace the need for good taste and clear thinking. But it eliminates the tedious parts of building software — the boilerplate, the configuration, the repetitive styling work. This lets you focus on the creative decisions that actually matter.
