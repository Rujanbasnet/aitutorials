## The Productivity Paradox

AI tools promise to make you more productive, but many people find they spend just as much time — sometimes more — after adopting AI. The problem isn't the tools. It's how we use them.

## Mistake #1: Vague Prompts

**The problem:** "Write me a blog post about AI." This produces generic, bland output that needs extensive editing.

**The fix:** Be specific about audience, tone, length, structure, and purpose.

Bad: "Write about AI tools."
Good: "Write a 1500-word comparison of Cursor and Claude Code for intermediate developers. Conversational tone, include a comparison table, and end with a clear recommendation."

The 2 minutes you spend writing a detailed prompt saves 20 minutes of editing.

## Mistake #2: Using AI for the Wrong Tasks

**The problem:** People use AI for tasks where it's slow and unreliable, while ignoring tasks where it excels.

**The fix:** Match the task to AI's strengths.

**AI excels at:** First drafts, summarization, code generation, brainstorming, data analysis, format conversion.

**AI struggles with:** Precise factual research (it can hallucinate), nuanced creative writing, tasks requiring your personal judgment, anything requiring access to private/recent data.

## Mistake #3: Not Iterating

**The problem:** People accept the first output and try to fix it manually instead of asking the AI to improve it.

**The fix:** Treat AI like a collaborator, not a vending machine. Give feedback:
- "This is too formal, make it more conversational"
- "The second paragraph is off-topic, replace it with X"
- "Good structure, but expand the section on pricing"

Three rounds of iteration with AI beats one prompt and manual editing every time.

## Mistake #4: Context Starvation

**The problem:** Asking AI to help with your code/project without providing enough context. The AI guesses, and guesses wrong.

**The fix:** Front-load context:
- Share relevant code files
- Explain the project architecture
- Describe your coding conventions
- Provide examples of what "good" looks like

More context = better output = less time editing.

## Mistake #5: Trusting Without Verifying

**The problem:** Blindly copying AI-generated code or content without reviewing it. This leads to bugs, inaccuracies, and security vulnerabilities.

**The fix:** Always review AI output. For code:
- Read every line before committing
- Run the tests
- Check for security issues
- Verify the logic, not just the syntax

AI is a powerful draft generator, not an infallible oracle. The review step is non-negotiable.

## The Right Mental Model

Think of AI as a highly capable junior colleague. They can:
- Draft documents quickly
- Research topics and summarize findings
- Write boilerplate code
- Organize and format information

But they need:
- Clear instructions
- Context about your project
- Feedback to improve
- Supervision on important work

Adopt this mental model and your AI productivity will skyrocket.
