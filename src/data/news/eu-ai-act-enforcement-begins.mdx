## Enforcement Is Here

After years of legislative development, the EU AI Act is now being actively enforced. Companies deploying AI systems in the European Union must comply with the new framework or face significant fines.

## Key Requirements

### Risk Classification

All AI systems must be classified into one of four risk tiers:

1. **Unacceptable Risk** — Banned outright (social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance)
2. **High Risk** — Strict requirements (healthcare, education, employment, law enforcement)
3. **Limited Risk** — Transparency obligations (chatbots must identify as AI)
4. **Minimal Risk** — No specific requirements (spam filters, AI in games)

### For High-Risk Systems

Companies deploying high-risk AI must:
- Maintain detailed technical documentation
- Implement human oversight mechanisms
- Conduct regular risk assessments
- Ensure data quality and bias monitoring
- Register in the EU AI database

### Transparency Requirements

All AI systems that interact with humans must:
- Clearly disclose that users are interacting with AI
- Label AI-generated content (deepfakes, synthetic media)
- Provide information about the model's capabilities and limitations

## Penalties

Non-compliance carries steep penalties:
- Up to 35 million euros or 7% of global annual revenue for banned practices
- Up to 15 million euros or 3% for other violations
- Smaller fines for providing incorrect information to authorities

## Global Impact

While the EU AI Act is European legislation, its impact is global. Companies serving EU customers must comply regardless of where they're headquartered. This is likely to create a "Brussels effect" where companies adopt EU standards worldwide rather than maintaining separate systems.

## What Developers Should Do

1. **Classify your AI systems** according to the risk tiers
2. **Document your models** — training data, evaluation results, known limitations
3. **Implement disclosure** — make sure users know they're interacting with AI
4. **Monitor for bias** — regular audits of model outputs across demographics
5. **Stay informed** — the regulation will evolve as enforcement begins

The EU AI Act represents the most comprehensive AI regulation to date. Whether you agree with every provision or not, compliance is now a business requirement for anyone operating in the European market.
