## The Next Generation

Google has officially launched Gemini 2.0 Ultra, the latest and most powerful model in their Gemini family. The headline feature is a 2 million token context window — enough to process entire codebases, books, or hours of video in a single prompt.

## Key Features

### 2 Million Token Context

The massive context window is the standout capability. Use cases include:
- Analyzing entire codebases at once
- Processing full legal documents and contracts
- Understanding hours of meeting recordings
- Reviewing complete research papers with all citations

### Native Multimodal

Gemini 2.0 Ultra understands text, images, video, and audio natively. It's not bolting on vision after the fact — multimodal understanding is core to the architecture.

### Improved Reasoning

Google reports significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks, particularly in mathematics, coding, and multi-step logical tasks. The model uses a new "deep thinking" mode similar to Anthropic's extended thinking.

### Workspace Integration

Gemini 2.0 Ultra is deeply integrated into Google Workspace. It can analyze your Drive files, summarize email threads, create presentations from rough notes, and more.

## Pricing

Google is positioning Gemini 2.0 Ultra competitively:
- **API access:** $10 per million input tokens, $30 per million output tokens
- **Google AI Studio:** Free tier with rate limits
- **Workspace:** Included in Business and Enterprise plans

## How It Compares

Gemini 2.0 Ultra's 2M context window is its strongest differentiator. Claude supports 200K tokens and GPT-4.5 supports 128K. For tasks that require processing massive amounts of information, Gemini is the clear choice.

However, initial benchmarks suggest Claude still leads on coding tasks and nuanced instruction following, while GPT maintains its edge in the consumer application ecosystem.

## Developer Availability

Gemini 2.0 Ultra is available now through the Gemini API and Google AI Studio. The model ID is `gemini-2.0-ultra` and it's compatible with existing Gemini API integrations.
