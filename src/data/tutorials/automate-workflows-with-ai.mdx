## The Automation Opportunity

Most knowledge workers spend 30-40% of their time on repetitive tasks that AI can handle. Email sorting, data entry, report generation, content summarization — these are all prime candidates for AI automation.

## Identifying What to Automate

Not every task should be automated. Use this framework:

| Good Candidates | Bad Candidates |
|----------------|----------------|
| Repetitive and predictable | Requires deep human judgment |
| High volume, low complexity | Rare, one-off tasks |
| Has clear input/output | Highly creative or emotional |
| Time-consuming but straightforward | Legally sensitive decisions |

## Quick Wins: AI Automation Tools

### Email and Communication
- **AI email drafting** — Use Claude or GPT to draft responses from bullet points
- **Meeting summaries** — Transcribe and summarize meetings automatically
- **Slack/Teams bots** — Auto-respond to common questions

### Content Creation
- **Blog post outlines** — Generate structured outlines from a topic
- **Social media** — Repurpose long-form content into tweets and posts
- **Image generation** — Create featured images and diagrams

### Data Processing
- **CSV analysis** — Upload spreadsheets and ask questions in natural language
- **Report generation** — Auto-generate weekly reports from raw data
- **Data cleaning** — Fix formatting, remove duplicates, standardize entries

## Building a Simple Automation Pipeline

Here's a practical example: automatically summarizing articles and posting to Slack.

```python
import anthropic
import requests

def summarize_and_post(article_url):
    # 1. Fetch the article
    content = fetch_article(article_url)

    # 2. Summarize with Claude
    client = anthropic.Anthropic()
    summary = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=300,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points:\n\n{content}"
        }]
    )

    # 3. Post to Slack
    post_to_slack(summary.content[0].text)
```

## No-Code Automation Options

You don't need to code to automate with AI:

- **Zapier + AI** — Connect apps with AI-powered steps
- **Make (Integromat)** — Visual automation builder with AI modules
- **n8n** — Open-source automation with LLM nodes
- **Microsoft Power Automate** — Enterprise automation with Copilot

## Measuring ROI

Track these metrics to justify your automation investment:
- **Time saved** per week (hours)
- **Error reduction** (% fewer mistakes)
- **Throughput increase** (tasks completed per day)
- **Cost savings** (reduced manual labor costs)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-automating** — Some tasks need human oversight
2. **Ignoring edge cases** — AI fails on unusual inputs
3. **No error handling** — Automations break silently
4. **Stale prompts** — AI model updates can change behavior

## Getting Started Today

Pick one repetitive task you do every day. Spend 30 minutes setting up an AI automation for it. Measure the time saved over a week. Then expand from there.

The goal isn't to automate everything — it's to free up your time for work that actually requires human creativity and judgment.
