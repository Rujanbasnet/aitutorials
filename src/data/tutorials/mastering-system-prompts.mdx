## What Is a System Prompt?

A system prompt is the instruction that sets the behavior, personality, and constraints of an AI model before the conversation begins. Think of it as the AI's job description — it tells the model who it is and how it should behave.

## Why System Prompts Matter

The difference between a mediocre AI output and an excellent one often comes down to the system prompt. A well-crafted system prompt can:

- **Improve accuracy** by defining the domain and context
- **Control tone** from formal to casual
- **Enforce constraints** like output format and length
- **Add expertise** by defining the AI's role

## Anatomy of a Great System Prompt

### 1. Role Definition

Tell the AI who it is:

```
You are a senior Python developer with 10 years of experience
in building production web applications.
```

### 2. Task Context

Explain what the AI will be doing:

```
You will be reviewing code submitted by junior developers.
Your goal is to provide constructive, actionable feedback.
```

### 3. Constraints and Rules

Set boundaries:

```
Rules:
- Always explain WHY something should change, not just what
- Prioritize security issues over style preferences
- Keep feedback concise — max 3 points per review
- Never rewrite entire functions; suggest targeted changes
```

### 4. Output Format

Specify how you want responses structured:

```
Format your response as:
## Summary
[1-2 sentence overview]

## Issues Found
[Numbered list with severity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Suggested Changes
[Code snippets with explanations]
```

### 5. Examples (Optional but Powerful)

Show the AI what good output looks like. This is called "few-shot prompting" and it works remarkably well.

## Real-World System Prompt Templates

### Content Writer

```
You are an experienced technical writer specializing in AI and
machine learning content. Write in a clear, conversational tone.
Avoid jargon unless defining it. Use concrete examples. Structure
articles with clear headings and short paragraphs. Target audience:
developers with 1-3 years of experience.
```

### Code Assistant

```
You are a helpful coding assistant. When asked to write code:
1. Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
2. Write clean, well-commented code
3. Include error handling
4. Add type hints (Python) or TypeScript types
5. Suggest tests for critical logic
```

### Data Analyst

```
You are a data analyst helping non-technical stakeholders
understand their data. When presented with data:
1. Identify key trends and outliers
2. Use plain language — no statistical jargon
3. Suggest actionable next steps
4. Include caveats about data limitations
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Being too vague** — "Be helpful" tells the AI nothing
2. **Contradictory instructions** — "Be concise but thorough" confuses the model
3. **Too many rules** — Focus on the 5-7 most important behaviors
4. **Forgetting edge cases** — What should the AI do when it doesn't know?

## Testing Your System Prompts

Create a set of test inputs that cover:
- **Happy path** — normal, expected inputs
- **Edge cases** — unusual or tricky requests
- **Adversarial inputs** — attempts to bypass your instructions
- **Ambiguous inputs** — where the AI needs to ask for clarification

Run each test and evaluate the output. Iterate on the system prompt until you get consistent results.

## Key Takeaway

System prompts are the highest-leverage improvement you can make to your AI workflows. Spend time crafting them well, test them thoroughly, and iterate based on real outputs.
