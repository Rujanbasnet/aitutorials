## What is Claude?

Claude is an AI assistant built by Anthropic. It excels at analysis, coding, writing, and reasoning tasks. Whether you're a developer, writer, or business professional, Claude can dramatically accelerate your workflow.

## Why Claude?

Here's what makes Claude stand out:

- **Long context window** — Claude can process up to 200K tokens, meaning you can feed it entire codebases or documents
- **Strong reasoning** — Especially good at step-by-step analysis and complex problem solving
- **Code generation** — Writes clean, well-structured code across many languages
- **Safety-focused** — Built with Constitutional AI principles

## Your First Conversation

Start simple. Here's a basic prompt:

```
Explain how neural networks learn, using the analogy of a child learning to recognize animals.
```

Claude will give you a clear, structured explanation. But the real power comes from **iterating** on the conversation.

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

Instead of "Write me some code", try:

```
Write a Python function that takes a list of email addresses and returns only the valid ones. Use regex for validation. Include type hints and a docstring.
```

### 2. Give Context

```
I'm building a FastAPI backend for a todo app. The database is PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM. Write the endpoint for creating a new todo item.
```

### 3. Ask for Reasoning

```
Compare React and Svelte for building a real-time dashboard. Consider: bundle size, learning curve, ecosystem, and performance. Present as a comparison table.
```

## Advanced Techniques

### System Prompts

When using the API, system prompts set Claude's behavior for the entire conversation:

```python
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="You are a senior Python developer. Always use type hints, write tests, and follow PEP 8.",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a function to parse CSV files"}
    ]
)
```

### Chain of Thought

Ask Claude to think step-by-step for complex problems:

```
Think through this step by step: How would you design a rate limiter for an API that handles 10,000 requests per second?
```

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics, try these next steps:

1. Experiment with different prompt styles
2. Try the Claude API for programmatic access
3. Explore Claude's vision capabilities with image analysis
4. Build a simple project using Claude as your coding assistant

The key is practice. The more you interact with Claude, the better you'll get at crafting effective prompts.
