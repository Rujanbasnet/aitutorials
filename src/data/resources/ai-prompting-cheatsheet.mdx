## Tips

- **Start broad, then narrow** — Let the AI generate first, then refine
- **Use delimiters** — Triple backticks, XML tags, or markdown headers to separate sections
- **Specify what NOT to do** — "Don't use jargon" is as useful as "use simple language"
- **Ask for alternatives** — "Give me 3 different approaches to this problem"
